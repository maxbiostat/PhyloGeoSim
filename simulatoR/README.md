Simulate CTMC-based discrete phylogeography down a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree


The objective here is to combine the capabilities from geiger, phylosim and spdep/maptools to incorporate geographic information, such as distances, availability of roads and neighborhood structure into the formulation of CMTC-based discrete trait simulation. This simulation tool shall be of great value in generating synthetic data to evaluate phylogeography reconstruction methods/software.

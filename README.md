PhyloGeoSim
===========

A set of R scripts to simulate phylogeography  using Continuous time Markov Chains

The objective here is to combine the capabilities from geiger, phylosim and spdep/maptools to incorporate geographic information, such as distances, availability of roads and neighborhood structure into the formulation of CMTC-based discrete trait simulation. This simulation tool shall be of great value in generating synthetic data to evaluate phylogeography reconstruction methods/software.

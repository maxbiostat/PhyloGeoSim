PhyloGeographeR
===========

A set of R scripts with utility functions for Bayesian phylogeography with [BEAST](https://github.com/beast-dev/beast-mcmc).

The plan is to have three basic modules 

- [elicitatoR](https://github.com/maxbiostat/PhylogeographeR/tree/master/elicitatoR) : this module helps create design matrices for generalised linear models (GLM) and set up marginal likelihood analyses for different predictors;

- [annotatorR](https://github.com/maxbiostat/PhylogeographeR/tree/master/annotatoR) : this module contains functions to summarise and visualise the output from BEAST;

- [simulatoR](https://github.com/maxbiostat/PhylogeographeR/tree/master/simulatoR) : this module will simulate traits down a tree using CTMC-based phylogeographic models.
